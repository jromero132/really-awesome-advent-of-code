# Contributing to Really Awesome Advent of Code

We welcome contributions to make this repository even better! Here's how you can get involved:

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any problems, such as:

* Broken links
* Incorrect information
* Missing solutions
* Outdated repositories

Please open an issue describing the problem. Be as specific as possible, including the relevant repository, year,
language, or section.

## Adding Repositories

Want to add a repository with Advent of Code solutions? Great! Here's what to keep in mind:

* **Complete Solutions:** The repository ***must*** contain solutions for all days of the Advent of Code event for the
* specific year you're adding it to. Partial solutions won't be accepted.
* **Correctness:** While we don't rigorously test every solution, please ensure your solutions are accurate to the best
* of your knowledge.
* **Relevance:** The repository should primarily focus on Advent of Code solutions. Repositories with unrelated content
* will not be included.
* **Active Maintenance:** The repository should, in the best case, show signs of recent activity or maintenance.
* Outdated repositories are less likely to be added.

To add a repository, submit a pull request updating the appropriate `readme.md` or `YYYY.md` file (e.g., `2023.md`).
Follow the existing format and include your repository under one or more of the corresponding language sections:

* The repository name and link.
* The badge for when was your repository last updated.
* In case of tools or utilities: add a brief description of the repository.

## Pull Request Guidelines

* **Clear Title and Description:** Use a concise title and description that clearly explains your changes.
* **One Change per Pull Request:** Keep your pull requests focused on a single issue or feature. This makes review
* easier.
* **Follow Existing Style:** Maintain the existing Markdown style and formatting of the repository.
* **Test Your Changes:** If possible, test your changes locally before submitting a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and considerate of others. Maintain a positive and collaborative environment.

Thank you for contributing! Your help is greatly appreciated.
